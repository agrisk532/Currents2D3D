<P>This program is an attempt to calculate from the first principles and render the superconducting electric currents and resulting magnetic fields of a high-Tc crystal in it's ground state.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>The main features of the program:</P>

<UL>
</U><LI>Include any size YBaCuO cluster in the calculation. However, the CPU time will increase accordingly. </LI>
<LI>Dope the system by removing (or adding) electrons. </LI>
<LI>Specify applied magnetic field value.</LI>
<LI>Both CuO planes of the unit cell are included in 3D calculation. For 2D rendering only one CuO plane. </LI>
<LI>Calculate and render in 2D or 3D space the 1D Cu-Cu bond electric currents. </LI>
<LI>In 3D space render the applied, strengthened, weakened and total magnetic field, produced by 1D currents. </LI>
<LI>Calculate and render in 3D space the true 3D electric currents. </LI>
<LI>Multiple document interface allows to work with any number of simultaneously opened windows from the same application. </LI>
<LI>Include different atoms in rendering. </LI>
<LI>3D volume ray cast alpha compositing, maximum intensity projection, isosurface, streamline rendering options.</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>At present several restrictions are present:</P>

<UL>
</U><LI>Only the YBaCuO crystal structure can be calculated. </LI>
<LI>No periodic boundary conditions. </LI>
<LI>No lattice defect option support. </LI>
<LI>Only CuO planes are included in the electric current calculation. No other atom layers. </LI>
<LI>Single gauge origin for magnetic field calculation, in the symmetry center of a cluster. </LI>
<LI>Fixed parameters for colors, atom radiuses, grid settings. </LI>
<LI>No phonon influence can be calculated.</LI>
<LI>Single thread program architecture </LI></UL>
